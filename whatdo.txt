- arthur requirement: path 
- root page = special? mm probably doesn't need to be
- pull page itself, need only a few bits of data
- pull subpages
- pull comments

notes:
- All page pulls (whether main or subpage) need to check permissions:
  = where cid in select cid from permissions where uid in (0, uid) and read = true
- easy to test
- show lock symbol for private pages (both main and sub)
- need to set markdown dataset on content div
- need to set title
