# Gon(e)tentapi

A ludicrously simple go frontend which connects directly to a 
[contentapi](https://github.com/randomouscrap98/contentapi) database
and serves (currently) readonly content. Made specifically as 
life support for old contentapi instances. 

May someday allow limited forms of writing (don't count on it)

## Requirements

- Go 1.22
- Ability to build CGO libs
- Target that accepts CGO libs (most do)
